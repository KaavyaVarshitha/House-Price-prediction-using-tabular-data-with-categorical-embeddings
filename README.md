# House-Price-prediction-using-tabular-data-with-categorical-embeddings

This project focuses on predicting house prices using a dataset that includes both numerical and categorical features. Categorical embeddings are utilized to effectively capture information from categorical data, enhancing the predictive power of the model. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Pandas.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates house prices based on various attributes, including both numerical and categorical data. We use deep learning techniques, specifically categorical embeddings, to handle the categorical features effectively, allowing the model to learn relationships that traditional encoding methods might miss.

### Key techniques

- **Categorical Embeddings:** Reducing high-dimensional categorical variables into lower-dimensional representations.
- **Deep Learning for Regression:** Using a neural network with embeddings to predict continuous values.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Including normalization and encoding techniques to handle mixed-type data.

### Features

-  **Data Preprocessing**: Automated handling of missing values, normalization of numeric features, and embedding for categorical features.
-  **Neural Network Architecture:** Built with Keras for regression tasks, utilizing embedding layers for categorical data.
-  **Model Evaluation:** Metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for performance assessment.
